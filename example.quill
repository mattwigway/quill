\maketitle

Quill is a document preparation system that allows authors to typeset
their work. It is a \LaTeX preprocessor which allows authors to use the
power of \LaTeX without needing to concern themselves with syntax in
all but the strangest cases.

Many of its features work just like \LaTeX. For instance, paragraphs
can be a single line or multiple lines, and are separated by a blank
line. The document header is standard \LaTeX, and all standard \LaTeX
commands can be used. There are also several other things you can
do. Here is a syntax summary:

\begin{tabular} { | p{3.5cm} | p{7cm} | p{2.5cm} | }
\hline
Bold (using \textbackslash{}textbf) & surround words with * & *Bold*
\\ \hline
Italic (using \textbackslash{}emph) & 
surround words with \_ :noquill
& _Italic_ \\ \hline

Percent signs & One can type, e.g., 57% and not have  & \\
& it turned into a comment, &
32% \\
& however, a \% not preceded by a number & \\
& is still a comment & % a comment
\\ \hline
Dollar signs & Generally, Quill will figure out if you want a formula or not.
If you are concerned, you can put whitespace after dollar signs to ensure that
they are not converted. If you use formulae and dollar signs in the same line,
Quill may become confused. Using the --no-dollar option turns all of this
behavior off. &
$500
$10 \over 14$ \\ \hline

Chapter headings & Three or more \# at the start of a line generates a new
chapter heading. The section heading used is \textbackslash{}chapter or the
heading specified by --chapter= (no backslash needed) & \\ \hline

Quotes & Straight single (') and double (") quotes are made curly & 
"double" 'single' \\ \hline

Excluding Quill & If you don't want Quill to process a line, simply place 
 :noquill at the end of that line (it can be in a comment or not, it will be
removed from the final output). There may be no non-whitespace characters 
after it. &
$45 \over 10$450 Quill would mangle this very odd line. \\ \hline :noquill	

Chapters & To start a new chapter, start a line with 3 or more \# signs, 
followed by the name of the chapter. By default, this generates chapter 
commands, however, passing in --chapter=section will generate section 
commands, \&c. & \\ \hline
 
\end{tabular}

# Quill: LaTeX for Authors

Quill is a LaTeX preprocessor that makes the most common LaTeX formatting effortless. The format it supports is described in example.pdf (which comes from example.quill)

Quill was designed to fill the need for a good print preprocessing system, to do for print what Markdown does for the web.

It reads Quill input on stdin and writes to stdout, so run it like:

`./quill.pl [options] < input.quill > output.tex`
